## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- Zustand for state management
- React Native Paper for UI components
- Various Expo modules for device features

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install Expo Go on your test device or set up an emulator/simulator

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
# Start with development configuration
npm run dev

# Start on Android device
npm run android

# Start on iOS device (requires macOS)
npm run ios
```

## Building

To create an APK build:

```bash
# Important: Clean build folders before switching between build variants
rm -rf android/  # On Unix-based systems
# or
rd /s /q android # On Windows
```
```bash
# For development build
npm run dev

# For preview build
npm run build-preview

# For production build
npm run build-production
```
> **Important**: It's recommended to delete the local android folder before switching between different build variants (dev/preview/production). This prevents package name issues caused by Expo caching the previous build configuration. For example, without cleaning, you might end up with a production build using the preview package name (com.blankjr.navigationclient.preview).
