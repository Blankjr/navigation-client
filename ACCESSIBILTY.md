#  for screen reader users

Here are the key accessibility enhancements we've made:

Image Descriptions: We've added an imageDescriptions prop to provide detailed descriptions for each image. These descriptions are crucial for visually impaired users to understand the content of each image.
Accessible PagerView: We've made the PagerView accessible and added an accessibility label that describes the overall gallery and a hint about how to navigate it.
Accessible Image Pages: Each image page is now accessible with a label indicating its position in the gallery and a hint containing the image description.
Page Change Announcements: When the user swipes to a new image, we use AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility() to announce the new image number and its description.
Accessible Indicators: The page indicator is now accessible, providing information about the current image position.
Accessible Swipe Hint: The swipe hint on the first page is now accessible with an appropriate label and hint.


These enhancements significantly improve the accessibility of the image gallery for visually impaired users:

Screen readers can now describe each image's content.
Users are informed about their current position in the gallery and the total number of images.
Navigation instructions are provided, helping users understand how to interact with the gallery.
Image changes are announced, keeping users informed as they navigate through the gallery.

To further improve accessibility, consider:

Ensuring sufficient color contrast throughout your app.
Providing text alternatives for all non-text content.
Making all functionality available from a keyboard (important for users who rely on switch control or voice control).
Testing your app with actual screen reader users to get feedback on the user experience.
